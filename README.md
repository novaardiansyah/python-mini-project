# Python Mini Project For Beginners

Hi Future Developer!

In order to gain better experience in developing programs with the new Python technology that I have learned, I am trying to start with small steps. In this case, I am trying to create some small projects that can help me learn Python. I hope these projects can assist in my learning of Python.
